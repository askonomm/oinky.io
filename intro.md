title: Super-sonic data-oriented static-site-generator
---

Take a moment and imagine a static site generator so fast it makes you ask yourself; "wait, is it done already? surely it didn't actually run, right?". 

And how fast is fast, exactly? Well, really, really fast. Compile time per page on average is <em>less than</em> 1ms, and most sites compile in less than a second. Have 1000 pages? Oinky compiles all that in just 3s. I've tested this on a MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip and 16GB memory.
