Handlebars plays a big role in Oinky. With it, you can create [layouts]() that determine how a Markdown content file should be displayed. [Partials]() that allow you to break Handlebars templates into smaller, more manageable, and re-usable pieces, and [pages]() which allow you to create dynamic pages side-by-side Markdown pages. Dynamic pages can be anything - HTML, XML feeds, JSON, whatever you want!
